    Completing my B.S. in Electrical Engineering from Texas Tech University in 2013, I am currently pursuing my M.S. in Electrical Engineering from Texas Tech. Through academics I have had exposure in embedded programming and hardware level programming. Other notable academic projects included experience in C# programming, MATLAB and image processing. Alongside my academics, I also pursued to get industrial experience through internships.
  In summer-fall 2014 I worked as a Systems Software Intern at Carl Zeiss Meditec, Dublin, CA. Here I received experience in medical device software lifecycle, functional testing, hardware testing and debugging C# based front-end applications.
  In summer 2015, I received another opportunity to intern, this time with Blackberry Corp. Redwood City, CA. as a Software Developer Student. Here I received training in continuous integration and related tools like Jenkins. I was assigned to the enterprise cloud infrastructure project and carried out DevOps roles that contributed to parts of the main architecture and managing VM configurations using Ansible. Apart from DevOps, I also contributed to development in a NodeJS environment, which included automation tools like Grunt and Karma and Mocha unit testing.
  With a diverse software background and a passion to learn new technologies, I feel I would be a good fit for this position.
