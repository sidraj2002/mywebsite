              Being a computer geek at heart and a big time follower of technological trends, it was about time for me to create a website to elaborate on my industrial and academic background.
              Although being an Electrical Engineer on paper, I consider myself a generalist, who likes to take on challenging projects or simply acquire in-depth knowledge about intriguing topics.
              Through this attidude and openness to learn, I have gathered experience working on a variety of projects ranging from academic projects related to logic design and embedded systems to
              web development and cloud deployment related software projects. My internships with Blackberry Corp. and Carl Zeiss Meditec helped me get on track with my software development experience.
              After completing my B.S. in Electrical Engineering from Texas Tech University in 2013, I decided to go for graduate studies and enrolled myself in the M.S. in Electrical Engineering program
              at Texas Tech University. In summer of 2014 I started my internship at Carl Zeiss Meditec, a medical device company specializing in Opthalmology devices. Here I gained extensive
              experience in medical device software life cycle, unit testing and hardware performance testing. After returning to graduate school in spring 2015, I received another internship opportunity,
              this time, at Blackberry Corporation. Here I was exposed to enterprize cloud application development, deployment and a the completely new field of DevOps.
              Apart from the interships, through Texas Tech University, I have gained extensive experience working on projects related to hardware level programming on FPGAs, embedded programming on MCUs and DSPs,
              medical image processing techniques on Matlab and software architecture design.
              The detailed project descriptions have been described on the website under the respective buttons. Please feel free to browse through and to contact me through the Linkedin link posted on the left.
              I'd like to thank you for visiting my website and for taking time to read through.
